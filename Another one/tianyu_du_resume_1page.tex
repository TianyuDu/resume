\begin{rSection}{Activities \& Projects}
{\bf Patient Data Analysis on PANSS Dataset} \hfill \emph{Jun.2019 - Aug.2019}
\\ \emph{The Final Project for STATS202 at Stanford University (Final Report Class Top)}
\\ Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) scores of schizophrenia patients were used to test treatment effects, k-means and Gaussian mixture were used to cluster patients based on scores prior to treatment. Moreover, SVM, random forests, and boosting machines were developed to detect potential invalid assessments and forecast patients' future psychological states.
\\
%\\{\bf Artificial Neural Networks in Economic Forecasting} \hfill \emph{May. 2018 - Jun. 2019}
%\\ \emph{Independent Research}
%\\ This project compared artificial neural networks and classical models on financial time series. Specifically, fully connected and RNN with LSTM cells were used on exchange rate forecasting, which had outperformed existing ARIMA and VAR models.
%\\
%\\{\bf Independent Reading in Mathematics: Mathematical Economics} \hfill \emph{May. 2019 - Jun. 2019}
%\\ \emph{Supervisor: Robert J. McCann}
%\\
%A supervised learning program focusing on microeconomic theory with mathematical rigour. Topics included duality theory in optimization, consumer and producer theory, partial and general equilibrium, as well as market failures like adverse selection.
%\\
\\{\bf CIBC Machine Intelligence Hackathon} \hfill \emph{Sep. 2018}
\\ \emph{Finalist Group (Top 5)}
\\
An auto-encoder-decoder architecture neural network was implemented to detect fraud in medical insurance claims.
